# FHE-based Decentralized Credit Bureau Using Encrypted Payment Histories

Harnessing the power of **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**, this project serves as a decentralized credit bureau leveraging encrypted payment histories. By enabling users to consolidate their FHE-encrypted transaction data from multiple sources—including banks and cryptocurrency payments—this innovative protocol generates verifiable, privacy-preserving credit reports.

## Understanding the Problem

In today's financial ecosystem, traditional credit bureaus often monopolize the evaluation of creditworthiness, leading to significant concerns regarding data privacy, accessibility, and fairness. Individual users have limited control over their credit information, which can be susceptible to misuse. Moreover, the lack of transparency in how credit scores are computed results in a widespread mistrust of the system. This project addresses these concerns by empowering users with ownership and control over their credit data.

## The FHE Solution

By employing the capabilities of Zama's state-of-the-art open-source libraries—such as **Concrete**, **TFHE-rs**, and the **zama-fhe SDK**—this decentralized credit bureau enables secure data processing. Users can authorize the aggregation of their encrypted payment histories without revealing sensitive information to anyone. Using FHE, the system generates credit reports that are confidential yet verifiable, thus disrupting traditional credit models and liberating credit data sovereignty back to the users.

## Core Functionalities

### Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Payment History Aggregation:** Securely compile FHE-encrypted payment data from diverse sources for an all-encompassing credit overview.
- **Homomorphic Credit Report Generation:** Generate accurate and trustworthy credit reports while preserving users’ privacy through advanced encryption techniques.
- **User Sovereignty:** Facilitate users in managing their credit identities independently, returning control over credit data to the rightful owners.
- **Next-Gen Credit System:** Redefine conventional credit systems by eliminating reliance on centralized authorities, fostering a trustworthy, user-centric credit evaluation mechanism.

## Technology Stack

This project is built upon a robust stack of technologies, with an exclusive focus on Zama’s FHE solutions:

- **Zama FHE SDK** (Concrete, TFHE-rs)
- **Solidity** for smart contract development
- **Node.js** for backend services
- **Hardhat** or **Foundry** for Ethereum development and deployment

## Directory Structure

Here’s a breakdown of the project's file structure for easy navigation:

```
creditBureauFHE/
├── contracts/
│   └── creditBureauFHE.sol
├── scripts/
│   └── deploy.js
├── test/
│   └── creditBureauFHE.test.js
├── package.json
├── hardhat.config.js
└── README.md
```

## Installation Guide

To set up the project on your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed. Check your installation:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory. Execute the command to install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Be aware: **do not** use `git clone` or attempt to copy the repository from any URL. Instead, obtain the project files directly through authorized means.

## Build & Run Guide

After successfully installing the dependencies, you can compile, test, and run the project using the following commands:

1. **Compile the smart contracts:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run tests to ensure functionality:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy your smart contracts to a local test network:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

## Usage Example

Here is a simple code snippet demonstrating how to generate a credit report using this decentralized credit bureau:

```javascript
const { CreditBureauFHE } = require('./contracts/creditBureauFHE');

async function generateCreditReport(userPaymentData) {
    const creditReport = await CreditBureauFHE.generateReport(userPaymentData);
    
    console.log("Generated Credit Report:", creditReport);
}

// Example usage with sample encrypted payment history
generateCreditReport(sampleEncryptedData);
```

Feel free to adapt the example to suit your specific needs!
